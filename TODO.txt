## TODO LIST / Idea list

Add screens with no dialogue/text etc. For example, when in room
    clicking should advance NOTHING, no text, only user ACTIONS should be able to progress the game

Basic stat counters

Time system
    turn-based, each action progresses time by X amount. mod 24
        add calendar, roll over days and weekdays

        [23:00 Wed]
        - do action
        [23:30 Wed]

    display time and date as overlay in HUD

Sleep event
    when action is sleep display specific event sequence
        choose sequence to display based on stats and flags (maybe add flags that update dynamically with stat updates) 
            action -> stat update ++ -- -> raise/lower flag
                when action is sleep choose dream scene based on flags
                    (update only before sleep?)

Basic inventory management
    Display overlay with icons OR list with item display and description on side
        OR mouse-over description
        ANDOR selection description

Add room customization
    add function to add/remove object decorations
        add interactable objects
    add function to change character sprite (costume)

Limit player saving to select stages/screens/phases (exclude dream scenes)

windowframe.png always has highest zorder
